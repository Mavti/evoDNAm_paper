There are 4 bash pipelines, they each run with their config file:
- BSvsChip.sh : performs the integration of ChIPseq and WGBS data  
Usage: BSvsChip.sh [-c config file] [-s stage]  
config file: BSvsChip.config  
  
- Annotations.sh : generate the annotation of TFBRs with methylome fragmentation information  
Usage: Annotations.sh [-c config file ]  
[-c config file]: provide config file  
[-s stage]: if specified, it must be either "CGI", "MethFrag", "cluster"    
config file: annotations.config    
  
- BPR.sh : identification of clustered methylation profiles
Usage: BPR.sh [-c config file] [-s stage]  
[-c config file]: provide config file  
[-s stage]: if specified, it must be either "input", "parameters", "clusters" or "features"  
config file: BPR.config  
  
- TFbindingDivergence.sh: performs cross species projection and annotation of TFBRs
Usage: TFbindingDivergence.sh [-c configFile] [-s stage]  
[-c config]: provide config file as input  
[-s stage]: must be one of "EPO", "intersect", "CrossSpecies", "LostPeak" or "finalTables"  
-h: print this help and exit  
config file: TFbindingDivergence.config

The figures and statistics of the article are within 4 Rmarkdown files:
